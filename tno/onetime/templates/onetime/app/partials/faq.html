    <dt>What is TNO?</dt>
    <dd>
        TNO stands for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_no_one_(internet_security)"
           target="_blank">
            Trust No One
        </a>
    </dd>

    <dt>Why TNO.io?</dt>
    <dd>
        Lack of web tools using TNO inspired the creation of TNO.io.
        TNO is a cryptographic practice where information is first encrypted
        and only then sent to the server for storage. By doing that,
        server does not technical capability to decrypt the data. As a result,
        the data is safe from prying eyes or 3 letter agencies...
    </dd>

    <dt>What services does TNO.io provides?</dt>
    <dd>
        Currently we only provide One Time Secret service.
        However please feel free to create GitHub issues
        to request new features.
    </dd>

    <dt>What is One Time Secret?</dt>
    <dd>
        One Time Secret is a secret, when created, can only be read once
        and then auto-destructs.
    </dd>

    <dt>How can I use One Time Secrets?</dt>
    <dd>
        One Time Secrets are perfect to send sensitive information,
        such as passwords, as links in emails. This is a lot safer
        than including such sensitive information in the email body
        since email is not always secure. The logic being that even
        if the email is compromised, no sensitive information will be
        leaked.
    </dd>

    <dt>How long is the information kept?</dt>
    <dd>
        TNO.io deletes all secrets after 7 days of their creation. Also
        as the name "one time secret" implies, accessing the message
        deletes the secret.
    </dd>

    <dt>Secrets are completely deleted?</dt>
    <dd>
        Yes. TNO.io deletes everything from the database related to a
        secret. Please note this does not flush the secrer (nginx) logs.
        As a consequence, some access logs might contain references to
        messages via their UUIDs.
    </dd>

    <dt>Can server decrypt my information?</dt>
    <dd>
        No. Period. Not in this or any other parallel universe.
    </dd>

    <dt>How is it possible server can't decrypt information?</dt>
    <dd>
        Cryptography, which is awesome. The essence of TNO is that the
        "client" encrypts the messages and only then sends ciphertext
        to the server for storage. This means that the plaintext information
        never leaves the "client" (e.g. browser). Also, since the server
        never gets the encryption key, it cannot decrypt the information.
    </dd>

    <dt>Is TNO.io open-source?</dt>
    <dd>
        Yes. I believe users should have the right to verify the claims of
        any service and that is what open-source allows. Also, this allows the
        cryptography community to inspect the crypto use since "the devil
        is in the details."
    </dd>

    <dt>What kind of cryptography TNO.io uses?</dt>
    <dd>
        Here are the cryptography primitives used:

        <ul class="spaceless">
            <li>AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) cipher</li>
            <li>GCM cipher block mode</li>
            <li>PBKDF2 as key-derivation function compute encryption key
            </li>
        </ul>
    </dd>

    <dt>I am a nerd! What is the encryption scheme?</dt>
    <dd>
        You ask and you will receive:

        <ol class="spaceless">
            <li>
                Browsers are not famous for their random entropy sources.
                To cope with that, the "client" requests the server for some
                extra randomness entropy (to be specific 80 bytes or 640
                bits).
            </li>
            <li>
                Client generates 640 bytes (or 640 bits) of its own
                entropy.
            </li>
            <li>
                Client <code>XOR</code>s server and client entropy to
                increase randomness sample quality.
            </li>
            <li>
                The randomness sample generates the following variables:

                <ul class="spaceless">
                    <li>
                        <code>IV</code> (Initialization vector) - 32 bytes
                        (256 bits)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>SALT</code> to salt user password - 32 bytes
                        (256 bits)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>ADATA</code> (associated data) - 16 bytes
                        (128 bits). <code>AES-GCM</code> will use this
                        during decryption for message authentication
                        instead of <code>HMAC</code>. This is taking
                        advantage of <code>GCM</code>'s feature to be able
                        to encrypt and authenticate a message in single
                        algorithm.

                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                "Client" calculates the <code>AES</code> <code>KEY</code>
                by using <code>PBKDF2</code> function with
                <code>pass</code>
                (user-supplied password). Please note that the password
                should be of good quality so no "monkey"s.
                <code>PBKDF2</code> uses <code>HMAC SHA256</code> with
                30000 iterations. We chose 30000 iterations because it
                seems to provide excellent security with reasonable
                performance. Also we chose <code>PBKDF2</code> because it
                has much better performance on mobile devices unlike
                <code>scrypt</code>. Although we might switch to <code>scrypt</code>
                in the future as mobile performance increases.
            </li>
            <li>
                Client encrypts secret message plaintext by using:
                <code>AES256-GCM(message, IV, KEY, ADATA)</code>.
                That in turn produces <code>ciphertext</code>
                and <code>tag</code>. <code>ciphertext</code> is the
                encrypted secret message and the <code>tag</code> is the
                <code>GCM</code> message digest. Since
                the server does not store the password, the "client" will
                use the <code>tag</code> during decryption to verify the
                password.
            </li>
            <li>
                Finally, the "client" only sends the following information
                to the server. Please note that the <code>pass</code> is
                not sent to the server. As a result, the server has no
                capability to decrypt the message since password is vital
                to compute the encryption key. In fact, the only way
                server can get plaintext is by doing brute-force attack.
                That is computationally expensive though because the
                "client" enforces good passwords quality. So no "monkey"s
                as passwords...
                <ul class="spaceless">
                    <li><code>IV</code></li>
                    <li><code>SALT</code></li>
                    <li><code>ADATA</code></li>
                    <li><code>tag</code></li>
                    <li><code>ciphertext</code></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                When the "client" decrypt message back, it first retrieves
                stored information from the server. Then it asks for the
                user password used to encrypt message. Finally it follows
                the same steps to derive the encryption <code>KEY</code>
                and tries to decrypt message. During decryption, it uses
                <code>tag</code> to verify the validity of the password.
                That is because having invalid tag will cause decryption
                to fail.
            </li>
        </ol>

    <dt>How server generated its entropy?</dt>
    <dd>
        We are using <code>/dev/random</code> Linux preudorandom number generator.
        It is a blocking device unlike <code>/dev/urandom</code> which ensures
        that it always generates good randomness.
